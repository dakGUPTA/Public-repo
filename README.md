# Multi-GPU Cahn-Hilliard Solver and Plotting Tools

This repository contains a high-performance implementation of the Cahn-Hilliard equation solver optimized for multi-GPU execution
and some Python scripts for post-processing and visualization.

ðŸ›‘ Other GPU-accelerated solvers are currently private.
